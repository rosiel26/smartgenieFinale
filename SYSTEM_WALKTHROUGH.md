# SmartGenie Bohol - Complete System Walkthrough

Welcome to SmartGenie Bohol! This comprehensive walkthrough will guide you through every aspect of our platform, from the moment you land on our website until you decide to log out. Read through the sections in order to understand the complete user journey and how all features work together.

## Starting Your Journey - The Landing Page

Your first experience with SmartGenie begins at our homepage when you visit `/`. This welcoming page is designed to introduce you to all the amazing features we offer. The page immediately greets you with our navigation bar at the top, which features the SmartGenie logo prominently. If you haven't logged in yet, you'll see Login and Sign Up buttons. If you're already logged in, you'll instead see a Dashboard button to take you to your personal dashboard.

The page's main headline declares "Discover Your Perfect Meal Plan" and describes how you can upload photos of dishes, get personalized meal plans tailored to your goals, and discover where to buy fresh ingredients right here in Bohol. Below this, there's a large inviting section showcasing our food analysis feature. You have two options here: you can upload an image from your phone's photo gallery, or if you're using a mobile device, you can capture a photo directly with your device's camera. Note that the camera capture option only works on mobile devices—desktop users won't be able to use this feature since there's no camera available.


## Creating Your Account - Sign Up and Login

If you're new to SmartGenie, you'll need to create an account. Click the Sign Up button to go to `/signup`. Here you'll enter your full name, email address, and choose a secure password. Your password must be at least 8 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character like @$!%*?&. This ensures your account stays secure. You'll need to confirm your password by typing it again to make sure you didn't make any mistakes, and the system won't let you continue until both passwords match exactly.

When you submit your signup form, SmartGenie checks to make sure no one else has already registered that email address. If that email is already in use, you'll see a message saying "This email is already in use." The system will also send a confirmation email to the address you provided so you can verify your identity. After signing up, you'll automatically be directed to set up your health profile.

If you prefer not to create a password right away, you have the option to sign up using Google or Facebook instead. Just click the Google or Facebook button, and you'll be registered much faster. Later, you can choose to set a password if you want additional security options.

If you already have an account, go to the Login page at `/login`. Here you enter your email and password. The password field includes an eye icon that you can click to toggle between showing and hiding your password as you type. If you enter incorrect credentials, you'll see the message "Invalid email or password" so you can try again. You can also log in using Google or Facebook if you signed up that way.

The system is smart about recognizing when you're already logged in. If you try to visit the login or signup page while already logged in, you'll automatically be redirected to your personal dashboard instead, so you don't have to navigate manually.

Forgot your password? No problem! Click the "Forgot Password" link and you'll be taken to `/forgot-password`. Enter your email address, and SmartGenie will send you an email with a password reset link. When you click that link, you'll be taken to the reset password page at `/reset-password` where you can enter a brand new password. Just make sure your new password meets all the security requirements.

## Building Your Profile - The Health Profile Setup

After you sign up, you'll be guided through a comprehensive five-step process at `/health-profile` that helps SmartGenie learn everything about you so it can give you the best possible recommendations.

In the first step, you enter your basic personal information. This includes your full name, your gender (male or female), and your birth date. The system is smart enough to automatically calculate your age from your birth date, so you don't need to enter that separately.

The second step focuses on your physical measurements. For height, you get to choose whether you want to enter it in centimeters or feet and inches—whichever system you're most comfortable with. The same flexibility applies to weight: you can use kilograms or pounds. This information is crucial because SmartGenie uses it to calculate exactly how many calories your body needs each day based on your size and activity level.

In the third step, you tell SmartGenie about your lifestyle and goals. You'll select your activity level from a detailed list. The options range from sedentary (if you do little to no exercise) all the way to extremely active (if you have a physical job or do intense training twice a day). There are also options in between for lightly active, moderately active, and very active. You'll also indicate how many meals you typically eat per day—the system defaults to 3 meals but you can adjust this to reflect your actual eating pattern. Finally, you specify how many days you want to give yourself to work toward your health goals. The default is 30 days, but you can customize this based on your timeline.

The fourth step is where personalization really shines. You'll select your health goals from a comprehensive list that includes weight loss, improving your physical health, boosting your energy levels, managing stress, optimizing athletic performance, or simply eating a balanced diet. You can select as many goals as apply to your situation. Then you choose your preferred eating style from several options: balanced (40% carbs, 30% protein, 30% fats), keto (very low carbs with high fats), low carb, paleo, Mediterranean, or vegan. Each style has its own specific macronutrient breakdown tailored to that diet philosophy.

You'll also select any allergens you have—the system includes options for peanuts, shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, tree nuts, soy, wheat, and sesame. Additionally, you list any health conditions you have, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, arthritis, asthma, celiac disease, or lactose intolerance. This ensures that SmartGenie recommends meals and workouts that are both safe and appropriate for your specific health situation.

The fifth and final step is automatic. The system takes all the information you've provided and calculates important numbers for you. It figures out your BMI (body mass index) using your height and weight. It calculates your daily calorie needs using the Harris-Benedict equation, adjusted for your specific activity level. Based on your chosen eating style, it breaks down exactly how many grams of protein, fat, and carbs you should aim for each day. Once this profile is complete and saved to our database, you're ready to start using SmartGenie! The system automatically takes you to your personal dashboard.

## Your Command Center - The Personal Dashboard

Once you're logged in with a completed health profile, you'll spend most of your time at `/personaldashboard`. This is really the home base where everything comes together. This is where you'll see your personalized nutrition targets, track your progress, log your meals and workouts, and get smart recommendations.

The very first time you log in, you might see a disclaimer modal that explains SmartGenie isn't a medical advisor and that you should always consult with healthcare professionals for any medical concerns. This appears the first time you log in and periodically thereafter (if you haven't used SmartGenie for a full day or more). You need to accept this disclaimer before you can proceed, and it reappears periodically to ensure you remember that SmartGenie is a helpful tool, not medical advice.

Your dashboard is organized into multiple views that you can switch between using tabs at the top. The nutrition protocol view displays your daily targets for calories, protein, fat, and carbs along with helpful visual indicators showing your progress. The status display view shows you visual progress circles with information about your current weight and how close you are to achieving your goals. The suggested dishes view shows you AI-powered meal recommendations based on your preferences, goals, and dietary restrictions. The meal and workout logs view displays what you've been logging over the past week.

In the nutrition protocol area, you see a clear display of your daily nutrition targets. For example, it might say you need 2,000 calories, 150 grams of protein, 65 grams of fat, and 200 grams of carbs. These are shown with nice visual representations and percentages so you can see at a glance what you need for the day. The status display shows your current weight, how close you are to your weight loss or gain goals, what percentage of your overall goal you've achieved, and your current activity level.

The suggested dishes section is particularly impressive. SmartGenie uses AI to recommend meals that match all your preferences: your health goals, your preferred eating style, avoiding your allergens, and being appropriate for your health conditions. Each dish suggestion shows a name, an image, quick nutrition information, and buttons to add it to your meal log. You can adjust the serving size before adding it, so if you want to eat more or less than the standard portion, you can customize it. If you want more details about a recipe, you can click to see all the ingredients and cooking instructions.

The recent meal and workout logs section displays what you've been logging lately. It shows your meals, workouts, and gives you quick statistics about calories and activity so you can see your recent patterns.

SmartGenie also includes a local store finder feature right on your dashboard. You can select a city in Bohol (defaulting to Tagbilaran) and filter by store type—supermarkets, markets, specialty stores, or organic shops. The system then shows you which stores carry the ingredients you need for your planned meals, making it easy to find where to shop.

## Analyzing Food Photos - The Food Analysis Feature

One of SmartGenie's most innovative features is the food analysis at `/analyze`. You access this by uploading or capturing a photo from the landing page.

When you upload an image, the system goes through a sophisticated multi-step process to figure out what dish you're eating and calculate its complete nutrition facts. First, it normalizes your image to a standard format to ensure the analysis works correctly regardless of what type of photo you uploaded or what device took it. Then it extracts visual features from the image using advanced canvas technology.

As the system works, you'll see a progress indicator showing you where you are in the analysis. You'll see steps like "Analyzing...", "Identifying dish components", "Calculating nutrition facts", and "Generating insights". The entire process usually takes just a few seconds.

Behind the scenes, SmartGenie is comparing your photo to all the dishes in its comprehensive database using multiple matching algorithms to ensure accuracy. It uses blockhash for visual similarity matching, SSIM for structural similarity index measurement, and pixelmatch for detailed pixel-level comparison. By using multiple methods together, the system can achieve really accurate matches even when photos are taken from different angles or in different lighting.

Once the analysis is complete, you're taken to the results page at `/result` where you see the name of the dish the system identified, how confident it is in that identification, and a complete nutrition breakdown showing calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates. You also get a detailed list of ingredients and the preparation steps. The system suggests what meal type it's best suited for—breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

If something goes wrong with the analysis or the system can't match your photo to a dish in the database, you'll see a helpful error message. In that case, you can try again with a different photo, or you can go back to the landing page and try other features.

## Planning Your Meals - Weekly Meal Planning

When you're ready to plan out your meals for the week, you'll visit `/mealplan`. This is a protected area that requires you to be logged in and have completed your health profile.

SmartGenie automatically creates an intelligent seven-day meal plan for you based on everything it knows about you. It considers your health goals, your eating style preference, your allergens, any health conditions you have, and makes sure all the meals together add up to balanced nutrition that matches your targets. The meal plan is displayed in a grid format with all seven days of the week along one axis and each meal slot (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) along the other.

You can see the date range for the week you're looking at (like "Dec 3-9, 2025") and each meal is represented with a thumbnail image and quick nutrition information so you can see at a glance what you'll be eating.

When you click on any meal in the plan, a detailed modal pops up showing you the full dish image, all the recipe instructions broken down step by step, and a complete ingredient list. For each ingredient, you see the name, the amount, the unit of measurement (grams, cups, etc.), and how many calories and macronutrients are in that ingredient. This is incredibly helpful if you're curious about what makes up the dish or if you want to understand the nutrition in detail.

You can add any meal to your actual meal log, and before you do, you have the option to adjust the serving size. If you add a meal for 150 grams instead of the default amount, all the nutrition numbers automatically recalculate based on your new portion size. Once you add it, you get a confirmation message so you know it was logged.

If you want to customize your meal plan further, you can override ingredient amounts, adjust portion sizes, or remove meals you don't want and ask the system to suggest a replacement that better matches your preferences.

The meal plan also integrates seamlessly with the store finder. After you select the meals you want for the week, SmartGenie generates a complete shopping list of all the ingredients you need, grouped by category and showing the quantities required. Then it recommends stores in your chosen Bohol city that have those ingredients in stock, showing you their locations and contact information so you know exactly where to shop.

As you add meals to your actual meal log, the system marks them as added on the meal plan so you can see at a glance which meals you've already logged and which ones you still need to prepare.

## Tracking Your Exercise - Workout Logging

When you want to log an exercise or explore what workouts are available, you'll go to `/workout`. The system maintains a comprehensive database of workouts, each with detailed information. For each workout, you see the name, a description, the MET value (which measures how intense the exercise is), the intensity level (low, medium, or high), which muscle groups the exercise targets, and whether it's suitable for different health conditions.

There's a search bar where you can type in a workout you're interested in trying. Results come back in real time so you can quickly find exactly what you're looking for.

When you select a workout, SmartGenie checks if it's safe for you based on the health conditions you listed in your profile. If the workout isn't recommended for someone with a health condition you have, you'll see a warning that says something like "⚠️ Warning: This workout is not recommended for users with [health condition]". You can still do the workout if you want—the system respects your choices—but you'll have acknowledged the warning.

To log a workout, you search for and select the type of exercise you did. The system shows you an intensity badge next to it so you know how demanding it is. Then you enter how long you did it in minutes. You can log anything from 1 minute to 999 minutes. The system automatically calculates how many calories you burned based on your weight, the exercise's MET value, and how long you did it. It also estimates how much fat and carbs you burned during the exercise. You review these calculated numbers, and then you can add the workout to your log. You'll get a success confirmation so you know it was recorded.

Your workout log displays all the exercises you've logged with the workout name, date, time, duration in minutes, and calories burned broken down into fat and carbs. The intensity badges are color coded for quick visual reference: green for low intensity (MET less than 4), yellow for medium intensity (MET 4-8), and red for high intensity (MET greater than 8).

## Reviewing Your Progress - The Daily Journal

At `/journal`, you can look at your meal and workout activity day by day in detail. You get a calendar so you can pick any specific date you want to review. The interface shows you a week view with all seven days visible at once, and the current day is highlighted so you always know where you are. You can easily navigate to different weeks to look at your history.

When you select a date, you see all the meals you logged that day listed by type—breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack. For each meal you see the dish name, what time you logged it, the serving size, and the full nutrition breakdown with calories, protein, fat, and carbs. You can click on any meal to see more details, edit the serving size if you made a mistake, or delete the entry if needed. You can also filter the display to show only certain meal types if you want to focus on one part of your day.

Similarly, you see all your workouts for that day displayed with the workout name, intensity level, duration in minutes, calories burned, fat burned, carbs burned, and the time you logged it. You can view more detailed information about any workout, edit the information if needed, or delete the entry.

At the bottom of the page is your daily summary that pulls everything together. It shows you how many total calories you ate from meals, how many calories you burned from workouts, and your net calories (calories eaten minus calories burned). Then it compares this directly to your daily targets for calories, protein, fat, and carbs. You see what you actually consumed or burned versus your target, what percentage of your goal you achieved, and nice visual progress bars so you can see at a glance how you did for the day.

The page uses pagination to keep loading smooth, displaying six items per page with next and previous buttons so you can scroll through your history easily without overwhelming the page with data.

## Managing Your Account - Account Settings

If you need to change your password, clear your historical data, or delete your account entirely, you'll go to `/account`. This is a protected area that only logged-in users can access.

At the top of the page, you can see your account information including your email address and your user ID.

There's a button to change your password. When you click it, a modal appears asking you to enter your current password (or if you signed up with Google or Facebook and never set a password, you can just set one for the first time). Then you enter your new password and confirm it by typing it again. The system validates that your new password meets all the security requirements.

There's also a button to clear all your health data. This is a significant action, so clicking it shows a warning modal asking you to confirm with your email address. If you go through with it, the system deletes everything from your health profiles table, meal logs, workouts, feedback submissions, and contact messages. This action is completely irreversible—once it's deleted, it's gone permanently. However, your account stays active, so you can recreate your profile from scratch if you change your mind later.

There's a delete account button for when you want to permanently remove yourself from the system. This is the ultimate deletion—the system asks you to confirm by entering your email address, and once you do, your entire account and all associated data are permanently deleted from our servers. You'll be logged out and redirected to the landing page. This action absolutely cannot be undone.

The page includes good security features to protect you. OAuth accounts have the option to set a password later if they want additional security. The system asks for email verification before you do anything dangerous like clearing data or deleting accounts. All the error and success messages are clear and informative, and you see loading states when the system is processing your requests.

## Getting Help - Settings and Support

When you need help or want to adjust your settings, you'll go to `/settings`. The page is organized into logical sections.

In the help section, you'll find a link to the FAQ at `/faq` where SmartGenie answers common questions like how the food analysis works, how meal plans are generated, how calories are calculated, what dietary options are available, how to log meals, and whether SmartGenie is giving medical advice. You'll also find a contact us link at `/contact-us` where you can fill out a support form with your name, email, subject, and message. When you submit the form, your message gets sent via email to smartgenie@gmail.com and you see a confirmation so you know we received it.

In the legal section, you can read the full terms and conditions at `/terms` which cover the service terms, your rights and responsibilities as a user, intellectual property rights, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution. You can also read the disclaimer at `/disclaimer` which explains that SmartGenie is not medical advice, shouldn't replace professional medical guidance, and that the nutritional data is estimated rather than exact.

There's a link to account management which takes you to `/account` where you can change your password, clear your data, or delete your account.

And at the bottom of the settings page is the logout button. When you click it, a confirmation modal appears asking "Are you sure you want to logout?" You can click cancel to go back to settings and stay logged in, or click confirm to actually log out.

## Other Features - Additional Pages

Beyond the main features, SmartGenie has a few other pages you might visit occasionally. The profile page at `/profile` lets you view a summary of your health profile, your goals, and your dietary preferences, with a link to edit any of them. The edit profile page at `/edit-profile` lets you update any information from your initial health profile setup. When you make changes here, the system automatically recalculates all your health metrics based on your new information.

The nutrition protocol is part of your dashboard experience and goes deeper into the science of nutrition. It explains what macronutrients are, how your daily targets were calculated based on your profile, and how you can adjust your nutrition approach.

The disclaimer page at `/disclaimer` shows all the medical and health liability disclaimers and has an acceptance checkbox if you need to agree to them again.

If you try to visit a page that doesn't exist, you'll land on the not found page (displayed for any undefined route) which shows a 404 error and a friendly message with links to help you get back to the dashboard or home page.

## Ending Your Session - Logging Out

When you're ready to leave SmartGenie, you can logout from either the settings page or the navigation bar. When you click the logout button, a confirmation modal pops up asking "Are you sure you want to logout?" If you click cancel, you stay logged in and go back where you were. If you click confirm, SmartGenie clears your session storage (removing the disclaimer flag and other temporary data), terminates your Supabase authentication session, resets your user state, clears all your in-app data, and redirects you to the landing page.

Once you're logged out, all the protected pages require you to log back in if you try to access them. The landing page shows the login and signup buttons again. You can log back in anytime with your email and password, or create a new account if you want to start over with a fresh profile.

## What SmartGenie Offers - Complete Feature Overview

SmartGenie has extensive features to help you reach your health goals comprehensively. The core features include AI-powered food photo analysis so you can identify any dish instantly and get accurate nutrition information, a comprehensive health profile system that learns all about you and your preferences, smart weekly meal planning that respects your dietary restrictions and goals, intelligent workout tracking that calculates calories burned based on your specific metrics, daily journaling so you can log all your meals and exercises in one place, and a local store finder that shows you where to buy ingredients in Bohol.

The system is highly personalized to you. You can choose from multiple eating styles including balanced, keto, low carb, paleo, Mediterranean, or vegan. You can list all your allergens and the system will systematically avoid them in recommendations. It understands your health conditions and recommends only safe workouts. And you can set multiple health goals to work toward simultaneously.

For account security and management, you get secure OAuth integration so you can sign in with Google or Facebook if you prefer, password reset functionality so you're never locked out, data privacy controls where you can clear or completely delete your account and data, and multi-factor security with email verification for any sensitive actions.

SmartGenie provides great user support through a comprehensive FAQ section, an email contact form for questions, complete terms and conditions that are transparent and fair, and clear disclaimers about what SmartGenie is and importantly what it is not (medical advice).

Technically, SmartGenie is built with React for a responsive, mobile-friendly experience that works great on any device, uses Supabase for secure data storage and authentication, has advanced image processing with multiple matching algorithms to ensure accurate dish identification, and includes caching to keep performance fast even with lots of data.

## How Everything Works Together - System Architecture

SmartGenie uses React 18 with React Router v7 for seamless page navigation and routing. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS so everything looks great on every screen size. Framer Motion provides smooth animations and transitions throughout the app. Various icon libraries provide visual elements. The backend is powered by Supabase with PostgreSQL for the database and robust authentication. Some heavy-duty image analysis happens in Deno serverless functions to avoid slowing down your device. Emails are sent through EmailJS so you can receive important notifications.

The system stores all your data securely in organized tables: your health profile information, meal logs with detailed nutrition, your workouts, all the available dishes in the system, ingredient information, store locations in Bohol, and store inventory data. Everything is connected through database relationships so SmartGenie can make intelligent connections between your preferences and recommendations, suggesting meals you'll love and workouts that fit your health profile.

## Important Things You Should Know

Your session remains active when you refresh the page, and tokens automatically refresh with OAuth logins so you stay connected without interruption. If you're inactive for a long time, you'll be logged out automatically for security. All your data is stored securely with HTTPS encryption, and you can delete it or clear your entire account anytime if you decide to leave. No data is shared with third parties—your information stays with you and SmartGenie.

SmartGenie is not a doctor or medical advisor. It's a helpful tool for nutrition and fitness tracking, but it's absolutely not medical advice. You should always consult with qualified healthcare professionals, especially if you have medical conditions or are taking medications. The nutritional data the system provides is estimated based on standard databases, not exact lab measurements specific to your food.

SmartGenie works best on modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. On mobile phones you get the complete experience including the ability to capture photos with your camera. On desktop computers you get all features except camera capture since there's no camera on your computer.

For the best results using SmartGenie, fill out your health profile as accurately as possible so recommendations match your actual situation. Log your meals consistently so SmartGenie learns your eating patterns and can give better suggestions. Keep your allergen list updated if your allergies change. Always review the food analysis results to make sure they seem reasonable and correct any misidentifications. Consult with healthcare professionals about medical conditions. And update your profile if your health situation changes significantly.
